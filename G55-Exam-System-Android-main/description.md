Hello, user. Welcome to the "Exam App", here you will get these opportunities:
1) As a teacher, you can conduct an online MCQ exam of your student
2) As a student, you can participate in the exam conducted by your respectable teacher.

Our motivation of building this app deals with the necessity of the best use of modern technology in
the sector of education. During the Covid 19 pandemic, the education system had no other option other
than embracing the modern technology to continue its process in this situation where it's not possible
to gather inside the classroom or institution together in order to maintaining the health security
and restrict the spread of the pandemic. Evaluation of students through examination is a significant
part of education, and with this app, our motivation is to help both the teachers and the students
to continue this process in online, where it will give them the opportunity to keep the pace of
education system in emergency situations too.
